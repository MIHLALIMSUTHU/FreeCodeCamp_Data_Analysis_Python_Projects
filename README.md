# 📊 Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

This project is part of the **freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python** certification.  
It takes a list of 9 numbers, converts it into a 3×3 NumPy matrix, and calculates:

- Mean
- Variance
- Standard Deviation
- Max
- Min
- Sum

Results are returned for:
- Each column
- Each row
- The full dataset (flattened)

## 🚀 Features
✔ Uses NumPy for efficient numerical calculations  
✔ Validates the input length  
✔ Returns clean Python lists (not NumPy arrays)  
✔ Matches freeCodeCamp test format exactly

## 🧠 Example

**Input:**
```python
calculate([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8])
